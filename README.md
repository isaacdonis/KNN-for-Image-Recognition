# KNN-for-Image-Recognition
A simple K-Nearest Neighbor algorithm to classify flowers from a dataset found on Kaggle.

The dataset can be found here: https://www.kaggle.com/alxmamaev/flowers-recognition/data
The information on how to model the KNN algorithm can be found from this lecture from Stanford University: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OoUX-nOEjG0&list=PLf7L7Kg8_FNxHATtLwDceyh72QQL9pvpQ&index=2
